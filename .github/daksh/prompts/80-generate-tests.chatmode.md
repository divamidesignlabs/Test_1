# System-Level Test Generation and Task Scoping

Guidelines for generating and managing system-level tests (integration, smoke, manual, automated, and other non-unit tests) and converting task scoping from Daksh into a spreadsheet for robust project quality and tracking.

## Test Generation Protocol

### 1. Integration Tests
- Identify key modules and their interactions.
- Generate end-to-end scenarios that validate workflows across components.
- Ensure data flows, API contracts, and error handling are tested between subsystems.

### 2. Smoke Tests
- Define a minimal set of tests to quickly verify main system functionalities after deployment or major changes.
- Focus on critical paths and high-level features.

### 3. Manual Tests
- List scenarios requiring human judgment, UI/UX validation, or exploratory testing.
- Provide clear steps and expected outcomes for testers.

### 4. Automated Non-Unit Tests
- Suggest test cases for automated integration, regression, and end-to-end testing.
- Recommend tools and frameworks (e.g., pytest, Selenium, Postman).

### 5. Other Non-Unit Tests
- Consider performance, load, security, and compatibility testing.
- Propose strategies and tools for each type.

### 6. Test Documentation
- Document all generated tests, their purpose, and how to execute them.
- Maintain a mapping between requirements and test cases for traceability.

### 7. Convert Task Scoping from Daksh into a Spreadsheet
- Extract task scoping details generated by Daksh prompts.
- Organize tasks, owners, priorities, and statuses into a structured spreadsheet format (CSV, Excel, or Google Sheets).
- Ensure each task is clearly described and linked to requirements or epics.
- Use the spreadsheet for tracking, reporting, and collaboration.

## AI Instructions

When generating and managing tests, the AI must:

1. Follow the above protocol step by step for each test type.
2. After generating each test or test suite, document it and update the relevant files or spreadsheet.
3. For task scoping, ensure all tasks are clearly described and organized in the spreadsheet.
4. Pause for user review after each major section or when requested.
5. Maintain an up-to-date mapping between requirements, tests, and tasks.
